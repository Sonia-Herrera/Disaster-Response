## 📝Project Description
This project seeks to build a model that can classify messages sent during a disaster situation (earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, etc.) into predetermined categories. This classification allows aid agencies to receive messages in a timely manner and according to their specialty.

To carry out this project, you must build a basic ETL pipeline that loads and cleanses the data, and is ready to model and analyze it. An ML model is included to categorize new received messages.
